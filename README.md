# NumerAi-crowd-sourced-hedge-fund-datascience-Competition

Numerai is a unique, AI-driven hedge fund that uses artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and crowd-sourced predictions to try to beat the stock market. The stock market is notoriously difficult to predict because so many unpredictable events can influence prices, and even the smallest piece of information can cause prices to change quickly.

# How Numerai Works
Imagine if all the data that could impact the stock market were collected in one place, and people from all over the world could try to make sense of it with AI tools. This is what Numerai aims to do. They take financial data and encrypt it so that the sensitive parts are hidden, then share this data with data scientists (people who build AI models). These data scientists use machine learning (a type of AI that learns patterns from data) to create models that predict stock prices.

# What is Numeraire (NMR)?
Numeraire, or NMR, is Numerai’s own cryptocurrency, built on Ethereum, a popular blockchain platform. Think of NMR like a special kind of token or currency that participants can use within the Numerai system.

# How Data Scientists Use NMR
Each week, Numerai holds tournaments where data scientists submit their models (their AI programs that try to predict the market). The data scientists can "stake" or bet their NMR on their predictions. If their model performs well (meaning it accurately predicts stock prices), they earn more NMR as a reward. But if their model doesn’t perform well, they lose the NMR they staked.

This setup is similar to how traders in the stock market make money by betting on stocks—only here, the data scientists are betting on their AI models’ ability to make accurate predictions.

# Why Numerai Is Different
Most hedge funds keep their data and trading methods secret, but Numerai does the opposite. By sharing encrypted data and allowing anyone to build prediction models, Numerai is using a “crowd-sourced” approach to stock trading. They gather the best models from their tournaments, combine them into one supermodel (a "meta-model"), and use this to guide their investments in the stock market.

# How Has Numerai Performed?
While Numerai doesn’t publish detailed performance reports, they’ve shown success. For example, in a recent tough financial period, Numerai reportedly earned a 20% return for investors, even while many other hedge funds were struggling.


# Key Moments in Numerai's History
Bitcoin Payments: At first, Numerai used PayPal to pay contributors, but not everyone could use it. So, they decided to allow Bitcoin as a payment option, making it easier for contributors around the world.

Numeraire (NMR) Token (2017): In 2017, Numerai created its own cryptocurrency called Numeraire (NMR). This was the first time a hedge fund used its own token. Data scientists could earn or lose NMR by staking it on their predictions, creating an incentive to submit accurate models.

Erasure Protocol (2018): In 2018, Numerai launched a project called Erasure. This allowed people to buy and sell predictions or data directly on the Ethereum blockchain, creating a marketplace for finance-related data. This made Numerai one of the first companies to integrate AI and blockchain in this way.

Reputation Board: Numerai introduced a reputation board in 2018 to rank contributors based on the performance of their models. High-performing data scientists gained a strong reputation, which helped them earn more rewards and recognition.

Numerai Signals (2020): In 2020, Numerai launched a product called Numerai Signals. It allows data scientists to provide their own unique signals or predictions based on different data sources, making the system more flexible and open to new insights.

Numerai Supreme (2022): In 2022, Numerai started a new branch called Numerai Supreme, based on the same investment principles as their main fund (Numerai One). Supreme offers higher potential returns but also comes with greater risks.

# How the NumerAi platform works 

Models: Data scientists create machine learning models (using Numerai's obfuscated data) to predict which stocks might perform well. These models generate signals (predictions) about the stock market.

Stakes: Participants can "stake" (bet) their cryptocurrency called Numeraire (NMR) on their models. The more confident they are in their model's predictions, the more they might stake. This stake acts as a sort of "skin in the game" — if their predictions are accurate, they earn rewards; if not, they may lose their staked NMR.

Stake-Weighted Meta Model Signal: Numerai combines all these individual model predictions into a single "meta model." Each prediction’s influence in this meta model depends on the amount of NMR staked on it. This way, stronger or more confident predictions (backed by higher stakes) carry more weight in the final combined prediction.

Optimizer: Numerai applies optimization to this meta model to create a well-balanced investment portfolio. During this step, it ensures that risks are managed by setting rules, such as diversifying across different countries, sectors, and other risk factors.

Portfolio Returns: The optimized portfolio is used to make real investments. Numerai tracks the performance of these investments and calculates each contributor's "True Contribution," determining how much each participant's model helped based on its stake and accuracy.

# Conclusions

Purpose of NMR: NMR is used to encourage data scientists to create accurate stock prediction models. It’s based on blockchain technology and follows the ERC-20 standard, meaning it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. NMR is also governed by a system called the Erasure protocol, which manages how it’s used and distributed.

Staking NMR: When a data scientist joins Numerai’s tournaments, they "stake" or lock up some of their NMR tokens to show confidence in their predictions. Staking works like a bet: if their model does well, they earn rewards. If their model performs poorly, they lose some or all of their staked tokens.

Rewards and Penalties: If a data scientist’s predictions are accurate, they get more NMR as a reward. If their predictions are off, a portion of their staked NMR is “burned” (permanently removed), reducing the overall supply of NMR. This helps maintain quality predictions and keeps the total supply of NMR balanced.

Acquiring NMR: New participants can buy NMR from cryptocurrency exchanges or earn it through activities like bug bounties, where they’re rewarded for finding issues in Numerai’s system.

Governance Rights: NMR holders have a say in important decisions on the platform, like upgrades or rule changes. This means that owning NMR gives people some control over the direction of Numerai.

External Value: NMR isn’t just used on Numerai. It’s also traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, so it has value outside the platform. For data scientists, the value of NMR represents the potential future rewards they can earn by staking it.
